1 About
-------

The Finnish Trainset is a NewGRF featuring Finnish Rolling stock from
1870 to present day. This trainset has been created by Finnish Trainset
team. See credits.


---------------------
2 General information
---------------------

2.1 Requirements
----------------
- OpenTTD 1.2.0 or nightly r23842, or higher
- Not compatible with TTDPatch


2.2 Installation
----------------
OpenTTD:
  see http://wiki.openttd.org/NewGRF
  This NewGRF is available from the ingame Online Content


2.3 Parameter settings
----------------------

Local, express and sleeper passenger MU/coach loading speeds can be 
defined using NewGRF parametres. Default values are:

Local: 40
Express: 25
Sleeper: 15

Purchase and running costs can be defined using NewGRF parametres.
Default parametres are:

Purchase cost setting: Medium
Running cost setting: Medium

Wagon and coach running costs can be turned on and off using
NewGRF parameter (Enable wagon and coach running costs)

Default setting for wagon and coach running costs is on.


2.4 Usage
---------
Everything in this set is Finnish rolling stock, in addition of several
wagon types from Eastern (Russian) and Western (Sweden, SeaRail)
interconnections.

Locomotives and multiple units featuring refitting are for deciding the
speed and traction effort suitable for freight or passenger operations
and/or livery refitting.

When livery refitting is available, the default setting is
year-dependent livery. That means when the livery is scheduled be
changed between specific years, locomotive, multiple unit or coach will
automatically update to the next livery.

The next option is build year livery, which means that locomotive,
multiple unit or coach will remain on the livery scheme as built. It
overrides the automatic update of livery, enabling former livery being
usable on the time when it's not otherwise available anymore.

The third option is to manually choose a livery from liveries already
introduced.

Speed and traction effort can be choosed at the same time (if locomotive
or multiple unit has one) with year-dependent, build year or manual
livery.

Wagon refitting behaves as in normal OpenTTD, there is cargo-specific
graphics on major part of wagons.

--------------
3 Known issues
--------------

Some wagons will appear too "tubeous" on consist. If you do notice too
tubeous wagons on consist, please report them to the Finnish Trainset
DevZone.

5 Frequently Asked Questions
----------------------------

Q: Why can't I use this in older versions of OpenTTD or TTDPatch?
A: This NewGRF uses some features only available to OpenTTD r23842 and
   newer. Furthermore, the most recent version of NML used to build this
   NewGRF, produces GRF version 8. This is only supported by OpenTTD
   r23166 and newer anyways.
